# about-me
My name is Jessy M.

I owned my own private dance/fitness studio.

I think my final outcome would be getting a job that is stable and in town. 

Day1 goal - Learn as much as I can in the timeframe giving and produce a designed webpage.

Two Truths and a Lie: 
a)Played amateur/pro vball in San Diego and was sponsored by Rusty gear.
b)I'm a Zumba Instructor
c)I used to be a pro skateboarder.
